## Comprehension Questions
Question | Answer
:------------- | :-------------
Did you have to resolve any issues when running the HTML Validator? If so, what were they? |
    Yes, a few stragglers. 


Why is it important to consider and use semantic HTML? |
    I dont feel like I did this very well, 
    but using semantic HTML keeps things clear and organized.


How did you decide to structure your CSS? |
    I went with an abstract/chaotic CSS structure.

What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? |
    Honestly, I am not pleased with the end result of this project.
    I have no experience with HTML/CSS, but for some reason thought
    that it would be easy peasy, so I chose to work on other things
    and got a very late start. 
    Turns out that if you want to make something that isnt lame, 
    it can actually be quite time consuming and tricky! 
    I didnt really finish the assignment and am not happy
    with what I was able to complete. 
    Next time I will spend more time on it and make the best website ever.

Describe one area that you gained more clarity on when completing this assignment |
    It is clear to me now that a beginner cannot make a sick website in one day. 

**Optional** |
Did you deploy to GitHub Pages? If so, what is the URL to your website? |
    https://mac-madison.github.io/personal-portfolio-site/pages/index.html
