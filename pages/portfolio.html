                <p>Once upon a time in ye olden days, to watch a movie, a person had 
                to head down to their local video store and rent a video. This app 
                will help an old-timey retro video store owner handle the back 
                end of their business.</p>

                <p>This Task List app allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks, 
                as well as mark them complete and sort them. When a task is marked 
                as complete, a notification will be sent to Slack. Tasks can also 
                be associated with goals.</p>

                stuff. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person

                <p>You and your friends enjoy watching things together online.

                to find things you've watched and your friends haven't watched, 
                or things that your friends have watched and you haven't watched!</p>
