 Task List API:
 https://github.com/Ada-C16/task-list-api.git

 <p>
 There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!
</p>
 <p>
If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!
</p>
We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:
<p>
Sort tasks
Mark them as complete
Get feedback about our task list through Slack
Organize tasks with goals
</p>

 Retro Video Store API:
 https://github.com/Ada-C16/retro-video-store.git


 <p>
 Once upon a time in ye olden days to watch a movie a person had to head down to their local video store and rent a video. We are going to step into the shoes of this old timey retro video store owner and build for ourselves a Video Store API to handle the back end.
