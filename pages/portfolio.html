                Once upon a time in ye olden days, to watch a movie, a person had 
                to head down to their local video store and rent a video. This app 
                will help an old timey retro video store owner handle the back 
                end of their business.

                This Task List app allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks, 
                as well as mark them complete and sort them. When a task is marked 
                as complete, a notification will be sent to Slack. Tasks can also 
                be associated with goals.</p>

                This app allows you to organize a swap meet! You have a bunch of 
                stuff. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person 
                could swap one of their things with another person's things.</p>

                Play Adagrams, a game in which a player is given a random set of 
                letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Each submitted 
                word will score points. (Completed with Sabrina Lauredan)</p>

                    You and your friends enjoy watching things together online. 
                    Of course, everyone has seen different things, has different 
                    favorites, and different things they want to watch. You've 
                    been using a spreadsheet to compare everyone's watched list, 
                    favorites list, and watchlist, but it's been getting too cumbersome. 
                    In order to find things you've watched and your friends haven't 
                    watched, or things that your friends have watched and you haven't 
                    watched, you have to comb through the spreadsheet. There is 
                    now an easier way using this app!</p>
