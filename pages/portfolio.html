    <h2>Career as an Adie</h2>
    <p>
      My interest in Python was sparked last year (2020) during the first COVID lockdown. 
      My job at the time required me to be on a university campus. I was able to see how 
      dispensable I was in that position. If it weren't for my direct supervisors, I donâ€™t 
      think I would have stayed employed throughout the beginning of the pandemic. I started 
      learning Python because it was suggested during my first linkedin learning mini course.
      I read about Ada Developers Academy when researching bootcamps and am so happy I did!  
      I have enjoyed being in this very positive and unique learning space. I look forward to 
      learning more and seeing what else I can build!
