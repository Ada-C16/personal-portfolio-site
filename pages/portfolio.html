        <h2> Projects completed by Roza Ajema</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
        Below are the projects that Roza completed while at Ada. Github references are also presented here. Some of the projects
        completed by pair programming, usually with one other adie.  
        </p>
        <ul class = "port">
          <li>Using python's data structures, this project creates a backend logic to compare everyone's watched list, favorites list, and watchlist, and finds things you've watched and your friends haven't watched, or things that your friends have watched and you haven't watched. Here is the github link, <a href="https://github.com/haset-19/viewing-party">Viewing Party</a></li>
          <li>In this project, vendors register online as a vendor. Also, they should list an inventory list of things. Then vendors can swap items between different inventories. The project creates a backend logic.
            
       For this project, given some features that the vendors want, it creates a set of classes, their attributes and instance methods, and some other cool features. Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category! Here is the github link, <a href="https://github.com/haset-19/swap-meet">Swap Meet</a></li>
          <li>Here is the github link, <a href="https://github.com/haset-19/hello-books-api">Hello books api</a></li>
          <li>This project creates a video store api that can help the owner to rent out videos for customers. It has the following minimum functionality:

            Customers, all CRUD actions
            Videos, all CRUD actions
            Video rental checkout, custom endpoint
            Video rental check in, custom endpoint
            Listing videos checked out to a customer, custom endpoint
            Listing customers who have checked out a video, custom endpoint. Here is the github link,
            <a href="https://github.com/haset-19/retro-video-store">video store api</a></li>
          <li>An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. Adagrams is a game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters.
             Each submitted word will score points. Here is the github link, <a href="https://github.com/k-nox/adagrams-py">Adagrams</a></li>
          <li>Solar system api creates different routes(for get, post, delete, put/patch and a route using query parameter to filter 
            using specific key-value pairs.) for a planet following CRUD. This project is also deployed in Heroku. Here is the github link, <a href="https://github.com/beaniebaye/solar-system-api">Solar system api</a></li>
          <li>Working with the Flask package:

            Creating models
            Creating conventional RESTful CRUD routes for a model
            Reading query parameters to create custom behavior
            Create unconventional routes for custom behavior
            Apply knowledge about making requests in Python, to call an API inside of an API
            Apply knowledge about environment variables
            Creating a one-to-many relationship between two models. This project basically features a web API to organize our tasks,  create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as there is access to the Internet! It also Reads and uses existing external web APIs/specifically slack api,
           and uses Postman as part of the development workflow. 

            We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:
            
            Sort tasks
            Mark them as complete
            Get feedback about our task list through Slack
            Organize tasks with goals.
