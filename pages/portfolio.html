    <p><a href="https://github.com/katiediaz/swap-meet">Swap-meet</a><br>
      <br>For this project we organized a swap meet! You have a bunch of stuff. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person could swap one of their things with another person's things.
      For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. Also, they should list an inventory list of things.
      You envision an app where vendors can swap items between different inventories. But what would that backend logic look like?
      For this project, given some features that the vendors want, create a set of classes, following the directions below. The directions will lead you to create many class definitions, their attributes and instance methods, and some other cool features. Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category!
      
      <p><a href="https://github.com/katiediaz/task-list-api"> Task-list</a><br> 
        <br>For this project I was asked to organize and create a task list. When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!
      If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!
      We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:
      Sort tasks
      Mark them as complete
      Get feedback about our task list through Slack
      Organize tasks with goals
      
      
      <p><a href="https://github.com/katiediaz/retro-video-store">Retro-video-store</a><br> 
        <br>For this project my goal was to create a video store API with the following functionality:
      Customers, all CRUD actions
      Videos, all CRUD actions
      Video rental checkout, custom endpoint
      Video rental check in, custom endpoint
      Listing videos checked out to a customer, custom endpoint
      Listing customers who have checked out a video, custom endpoint
