      Here is a list of work that I have done since joining Ada Developers Academy's Cohort 16.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ngoziamaefule/swap-meet">Swap Meet</a>
        <p>
          You want to organize a swap meet! You have a bunch of stuff. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person could swap one of their things with another person's things.
          
          For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. Also, they should list an inventory list of things.
          
          You envision an app where vendors can swap items between different inventories. But what would that backend logic look like?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ngoziamaefule/solar-system-api">Solar System API</a>
        <p>
          This API will store information about different planets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ngoziamaefule/viewing-party">Viewing Party</a>
        <p>
          You and your friends enjoy watching things together online. Of course, everyone has seen different things, has different favorites, and different things they want to watch.
          
          You've been using a spreadsheet to compare everyone's watched list, favorites list, and watchlist, but it's been getting too cumbersome. In order to find things you've watched and your friends haven't watched, or things that your friends have watched and yo haven't watched, you have to comb through the spreadsheet. You know that there are different ways we can get that information: we can use Python!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ngoziamaefule/adagrams-py">Adagrams</a>
        <p>
          An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. In this project you and your partner will be creating Adagrams, a game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Each submitted word will score points.
          While working on Adagrams, it may help to think of a physical metaphor for this game, such as other common word games like Scrabble or Bananagrams. These games all feature a pool of letter tiles that the player draws from.
          
          In this version of Adagrams, we will only be working with the English alphabet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ngoziamaefule/task-list-api">Task List</a>
        <p>
          There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!

          If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!
