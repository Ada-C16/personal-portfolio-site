            <p> 
                The goddess here is intended to be for a pocket-sized portrayal to pray to. The background represents the tale of her shedding the thousand vulvae she was cursed with in a shower of red. She is left with eyes in place of the female markings that once covered their body.

                    Often queerness in Hindu folklore is used to demonstrate a purpose: For instance, Chudala who became a man to enlighten her husband for overcoming patriarchy, Narada wanting to be a part of the raas-leela (dance) and changing gender as a metaphor for shedding ego, Krishna and Radha swapping clothes with the bold claim that ‘clothes do not make us who we are!’. These are all written in the lens avoiding the inherent queerness, and with the way they’ve been passed down, it’s reframed in the narrative of an allegory and instead gives the impression of the reader to assume this is most definitely the epitome of cisgenderhood. I come to rewrite and build ancestry; I want queerness simply for the sake of queerness.

                    This series is devoted to the goddess of my own creation. To permanently mark her into history, I will tell her story as folklore and write them into existence as fact. Her physical form is depicted with four arms (to signal divinity and her ability to perform multiple tasks at once). They also wear a nose ring on the left nostril which is culturally regarded as the “gay side”. She also wears a braid in their hair, a traditionally “feminine” portrayal, while also leaving most of it down to signal masculinity. Different parts of India portray them in different ways to their local culture (e.g. straight vs curlier hair for northern vs southern India). Most notable from her appearance are the numerous eyes covering her form.
