            <h2>ABOUT </h2>
            <p>
                At the very threshold of my home– of my life– the entrypoint to my personal space, this smallest opening is one you do not hesitate to take advantage of.
            </p>
            <h3>In My Home</h3>
            <div class = "artist-statement">
                <p>
                    'In My Home' is an invasive experience, to make you feel perverse, like you are impeding on the most private, intimate moments- and that's exactly what you are doing. The lesbian experience is so muddled with voyeuristic behaviors, and this is to make you– the unwelcomed, unwanted voyeur– feel as uncomfortable as I do. To be fetishized, to be questioned, to be put up for the public's disposal unwillingly, to become a spectacle for merely existing. You should feel unwelcome. You should feel creepy watching me in these places. Your presence and commentary, your searching eyes and opinions, these are not meant for my personal life. I pass on the feelings you have burdened me with; you are the one in the wrong, not me.
