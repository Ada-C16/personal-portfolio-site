            <p>
                This print shows the life of the remote goddess being worshipped in a rural shrine. There she meets who they consider to be the most devoted believer, offering a tomato for prasada. Before being able to ask for a piece, the believer offers to share it. The goddess begins to help her believer tend to her bountiful garden, silently blessing it all along. Their seed of their love is planted in this time and begins to blossom at the first tomato of the next season.

                    Often queerness in Hindu folklore is used to demonstrate a purpose: For instance, Chudala who became a man to enlighten her husband for overcoming patriarchy, Narada wanting to be a part of the raas-leela (dance) and changing gender as a metaphor for shedding ego, Krishna and Radha swapping clothes with the bold claim that ‘clothes do not make us who we are!’. These are all written in the lens avoiding the inherent queerness, and with the way they’ve been passed down, it’s reframed in the narrative of an allegory and instead gives the impression of the reader to assume this is most definitely the epitome of cisgenderhood. I come to rewrite and build ancestry; I want queerness simply for the sake of queerness.

                    This series is devoted to the goddess of my own creation. To permanently mark her into history, I will tell her story as folklore and write them into existence as fact. Her physical form is depicted with four arms (to signal divinity and her ability to perform multiple tasks at once). They also wear a nose ring on the left nostril which is culturally regarded as the “gay side”. She also wears a braid in their hair, a traditionally “feminine” portrayal, while also leaving most of it down to signal masculinity. Different parts of India portray them in different ways to their local culture (e.g. straight vs curlier hair for northern vs southern India). Most notable from her appearance are the numerous eyes covering her form.
