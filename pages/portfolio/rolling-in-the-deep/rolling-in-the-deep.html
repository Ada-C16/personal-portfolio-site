                I think this was one of my earlier big prints. Probably the biggest I had done at that time, a new personal record.
                It was ... overwhelming, to say the least. But at some point I had gotten in the "zone". The artist zone where my body kind of took over.
                The kind where I ran a little bit on auto-pilot, let my muscle memory take over. And then I inked it and was so pleasantly surprised.
                My style was surprisingly compatible with this medium.
