      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p id=aboutme>
        I spent 7 years working in the aerospace industry designing primary structure on Boeing Aircrafts. 
        I lead multidisciplinary teams to create high quality, value driven, integrated design solutions while successfully maintaining schedule and budget. 
        Throughout this time, I discovered my passion for creating valuable customer-centric products and collaborating on multidisciplinary teams. 
        I have taken this passion and drive into the software development field where I wish to continue to support customer needs and develop scalable, adaptable, thoughtful application features.</p>
