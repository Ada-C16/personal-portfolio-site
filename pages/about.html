      <h2> My favourite creatures</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I have a special heart to birds. Everytime I see their shape, color and size variation, I am speechless to the creator. Here are some of them in picture.
        Each colour, each stroke is with purpose which could be survival, camouflage or attraction. What is amazing is that nature is the master at aesthetics plus practicality.
