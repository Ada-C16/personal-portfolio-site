      <p> I'm a software engineering student at Ada Developers Academy. I'm looking to become a junior developer at one of the big tech firms such as Coinbase.I find the blockchain very interesting. It allows individuals to use a decentralized network to send funds, notes, comments and music playlist. I have high hopes for the future and look forward to engaging with friends in the metaverse while sharing my experience on the blockchain network. Things that I enjoy are ATLA(Avatar the Last Airbender), glass nails, my earring collection, and makeup/skincare. My favorite Avatar is Avatar Kyoshi.  </p>
