    <p>Hi! My name is Melinda Hayes and I'm currently a full time student studying to be a full stack software developer at Ada Developers Academy. A little bit about me, I moved here to Washington from Hawaii at the beginning of 2021. This is my first time living away from Hawaii and it has been a pretty good cultural shock. Touching snow for the first time and being able to experience all 4 seasons, but it has been amazing and very cold. Things I like to do in my spare time is hiking, being outdoors and hanging out with friends. </p>
