    Ivette Fernandez (she/her) was born and raised in North Carolina in a Cuban family, so yes her accent goes all over the place.
      Here are some quick facts about her: </p>
    
    <ul id="about-list">
      <li>a fan of lizards</li>
      <li>currently based in Chicago</li>
      <li>pretty queer in every sense of the word</li>
      <li>used to listen to rock music written about the British Sci-Fi series Doctor Who</li>
      <li>has never met anybody named Garth (but would like to!)</li>
    </ul>
  <p id="about-p2">  Ivette can't imagine there's anything else you would need to know about her, but just in case you have a really outlandish question (or if you are named Garth and you'd like to meet up), you can email her at: <a href="mailto:ivette.diana.fernandez@gmail.com" target="_blank">ivette.diana.fernandez@gmail.com</a>
