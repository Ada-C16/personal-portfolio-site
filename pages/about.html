        A little bit about me: 
        <ul>
            <li>I am in school to become a full-stack developer, though my love is for back-end development.</li>
            <li>I have a Masters in Social Work which allows me to think critically in my problem solving and come up with diverse solutions in coding.</li>
            <li>I love being in nature (hiking, rock climbing, camping), spending time with community, and participating in activism.</li>
            <li>I am going to edit all of this once it actually goes live. Right now I'm just practicing for class.</li> 
        </ul>
