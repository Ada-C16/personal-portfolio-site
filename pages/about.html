        <h2>You want to learn more about me, you say?</h2>
        <p>Well, I won't bore you with too many facts, so I'll start with the basics</p>
        <p>My pronouns are she/her.I am currently a student at <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> which is a tuition-free full-stack web development program for women and gender-diverse folks.
        Previously, I worked as a Sales Development Representative in a Seattle tech company. After some life-changing events and re-evaluation, 
        I discovered the world of programming and decided to pursue it as my career. 
        Was it a difficult decision? Oh, absolutely. Was it the right decision for me? Without a doubt! 
        I wouldn't be able to create my own website otherwise!</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy catching up with friends and trying new food. Something I recently tried for the first time is beef bourguignon with creamy polena and it was delicious! 
        In the summer I'll also take walks at the beach or park. And in the winter, I like to have show marathons and go snowboarding at the local mountains here in the Seattle area. My post-Covid and post-Ada goal is to first travel to Japan again, and then to Europe.</p>
