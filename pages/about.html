  <h1 class="main"> My Life til Now</h1>
  <p>
    Non-traditional software developer on a rollercoaster of a journey. It was a dark and
    dreary morning and I had just started my child on their homeschooling journey. While
    they were busy working on their work, I sat back and observed from my own work. I was
    studying to be a teacher, another non-traditional route for me, but alas, I was bored.
