     Ro began their foray into software development as a bioinformatician.
     They became interested in computer science while troubleshooting a web app for genome annotations.
     Their favorite things about programming are the creative freedom and potential it has for reaching and improving many people's quality of life.
     When Ro isn't coding, they enjoy movies, escape rooms, performance art, skiing, and hiking.
