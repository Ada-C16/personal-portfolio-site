    Non-traditional software developer on a rollercoaster of a journey. It was a dark and
    dreary morning and I had just started my child on their homeschooling journey. While
    they were busy working on their work, I sat back and observed from my own work. I was
    studying to be a teacher, another non-traditional route for me, but alas, I was bored.

    It just so happened that on this fateful day, my child finished their work early and had 
    decided to work on another game for fun. As children tend to do, they left their work out.
    This work was the screen in which they had their programming homework on. My partner had set
    up this particular activity, so it was all new to me. Still, I hadn't thought of being able 
    to learn about programming in such a fun, gamefied way.

    The next thing I knew, I was engrossed in this CodeCombat "lesson". I found myself being pulled
    out of it hours later by my partner, who was quite amused at my expense. I had to share my
    excitement. The next thing I knew, I found myself scouring the good old internet for alternative
    sources of learning as an intro to computer programming. Then I found myself applying to my current
    software development bootcamp. The rest, as they say, is <i>herstory</i>.
