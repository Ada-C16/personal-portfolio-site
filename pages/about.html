          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a student at Ada Developers Academy learning to be a full-stack software developer. 
            I will graduate in July 2022. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am the first in my family to attend and graduate college. I have a Bachelor’s degree in English Literature and I worked for a large public library for 8 1/2 years. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I have two cats and one dog. Buddy (pictured on the left) is 
            and Blue (on the right) were adopted from the shelter in 2015.
            Lola we got from a family who could no longer care for her. You could say she picked us.
