    <h2> My Story</h2>
    <p> When I was 7, I led a team of ragtag underdogs to victory in the 1995 NASA Ames Space Camp Spacebowl trivia competition. I met Buzz Aldrin and vowed my life to space exploration.
        Somewhere between the ages of 8 and 32, I made the difficult decision to stay firmly on Earth. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyways, here I am, a student in the C16 cohort at Ada Developers Academy. I grew up in the foothills of an ancient volcano with a software engineer father and a mom I call every day.
        My sister once filled up my dorm room floor to ceiling with balloons and cries when she laughs too hard.
        I love to hike, I have an immortal cat that I found on the street, and a dog whose original owners gave her to me so they could move to Switzerland to open up a donut shop.
        I like to ride my bike. My boyfriend laughs at all my jokes.

        I hope you enjoy my portfolio!
