      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p id=aboutme>
        I have always had a deep interest for making things. 
        As a kid it was art projects and obstacle courses for my gerbil, in college it was undergraduate research projects, 
        and as a working professional in the in the aerospace industry for 7 years it was designing primary airplane structure. 
        I have come to realize that, likes other projects I enjoy, coding is a way to make something out of nothing and merges creativity and innovation. 
        Throughout my career at Boeing, I lead multidisciplinary teams to create high quality, value driven, integrated design solutions while successfully maintaining schedule and budget. 
        In this time, I discovered my passion for creating valuable customer-centric products and collaborating on multidisciplinary teams. 
        I have taken this passion and drive into the software development field where I wish to continue to support customer needs and develop scalable, adaptable, thoughtful application features.

      <h3>Commitment to DEI</h3>
      <p>I believe that having a commitment to diversity is choosing to pay my own privilege and experiences forward. 
        Being able to make an impact in the tech world is more than just being technically sound. 
        Working on diverse teams and having a deep understanding of how to promote inclusivity is essential to the future of tech. 
        I hope to use my career as a software developer to listen to, learn from, and help to foster the development of those less represented in the field. 
        Throughout my time as an engineering student and working professional, I have found it important to engage in programs that promote diversity in STEM fields. 
        I have participated in and organized outreach events that aim to get more young folks, particularly women and minorities, interested in STEM. 
        In my personal life, I have made it a priority to make the outdoors more accessible to kids that would not normally have the opportunity to participate in outdoor recreation. 
        Over the past three years I have volunteered with organizations like Vertical Generation and SOS Outreach, mentoring underserved youth in sports like rock climbing and snowboarding. 
        These experiences have reinforced to me how important it is to promote diversity and inclusion in the communities that I am a part of. 
        As a queer woman of color, I hope to leverage the opportunities and privilege that I have been given in my life to further create safe spaces for growth for underrepresented people in tech</p>
