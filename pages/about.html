  <p> Ivette Fernandez (she/her) was born and raised in North Carolina in a Cuban family, so yes her accent goes all over the place.
    Here are some quick facts about her:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a fan of lizards</li>
    <li>currently based in Chicago</li>
    <li>pretty queer in every sense of the word</li>
    <li>used to listen to rock music written about the British Sci-Fi series Doctor Who</li>
    <li>has never met anybody named Garth (but would like to!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ivette can't imagine there's anything else you would need to know about her, but just in case you have a really outlandish question (or if you are named Garth and you'd like to meet up), you can email her at: <a href="mailto: ivette.diana.fernandez@gmail.com">ivette.diana.fernandez@gmail.com</a></p>
