      <p>A brief history of me told in the 3rd person: Genie was born and raised in Atlanta, Ga.
        As a first-generation American, Genie grew up in a bilingual, Mexican household with her older brother.
        As a child, she enjoyed art, dancing, playing outside, and building with legos. 
        She loved school and knew at a very young age that she wanted to be a teacher. 
        Upon graduating from Emory University a major in Political Science/French, Genie moved to France to teach. 
        She then spent the next 6 years teaching in the U.S. The COVID-19 pandemic opened her eyes to the tech gap that existed among her students and their families. 
        So she decided to jump into tech. 
        Each day, she carries the experiences she had in the classroom to make sure that the most vulnerable populations are kept in mind in the advancing tech world.</p>
